AISLEAIDE
As a society seeks for equal rights and opportunities, developing a creative solution to empower Visually Imapired people by revolutionizing the grocery shopping experience and building self-reliance and confidence through the creation of an inclusive and accessible platform

Our primary goal in designing an app is to bring about a change in society where people with visual impairments have equal access to necessary services and are provided with the means to carry out everyday tasks with confidence and independently. By this innovative choice, we hope to significantly contribute to building a society that is more inclusive and equal for everyone
Our solution for this is to introduce a mobile application named ‘AisleAide’ which means aiding or helping the VI shoppers through the Aisles of the supermarket.
